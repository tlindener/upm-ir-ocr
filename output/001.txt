This study was to determine the median lethal concentration (LCSO) of copper
to Javenese carp, Puntius gonionotus (Bleeker), and the immune response
after the ï¬�sh were exposed to sublethal levels of copper and challenged with
formalin killed Aer-omonas hydrophila. The LCM, of copper on P. gonionotus at
24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h were estimated as 2-17, 0-91, 0-57, 0-53 and 0-42 mg l" 1,
respectively. To determine the effect of copper 0n the immune system, ï¬�sh
were exposed for 66 days to 0-05, 0-10 and 0-15 mg Cu l" 1. After 56 days of
initial exposure to copper, fish were challenged with 0-1 ml of 4-5 >< 10"â€™cfu
ml 7' l formalin killed A. hydrophila and maintained in the same concentration
of copper. After the challenge, the immune response was monitored for
2 weeks using haematological and serological assays. During the initial phase
of exposure to copper, signiï¬�cant changes were noted in the White blood cell,
lysozyme, potential killing activity, total plasma protein, total immunoglobu-
lin and haematocrit levels between the control and treated ï¬�sh. One week
after challenge with A. hydrophila, there was a signiï¬�cant increase in the
values of White blood cells, total protein and total immunoglobulin compared
to the values before the challenge. However, these values were not signiï¬�-
cantly different (P>0~05) between the control and the treated ï¬�sh. In contrast,
NBT and lysozyme assays exhibited a signiï¬�cant difference (P<0-05) in ï¬�sh
exposed to 0-10 mg Cu l l (0-525i0-17; 244213-35 X 102,11mg mlil) and
0-15 mg Cu l"1 (0-536i0-19: 21-78i1-29 >< 102pmg ml 1) compared to the
control (0-746 i 0-31; 30-73 i 5-42 >< 102 pmg ml 7 1) after the bacterial challenge
(day 61). There was however n0 signiï¬�cant difference (P>0-05) in NBT and
lysozyme levels in ï¬�sh exposed to lower level of copper (0-05 mg Cu l 1),
suggesting the absence of immunosuppressive effects at lower level of
exposure. (j 2001 Academic Press

I. Introduction
Metals are released at sublethal concentration into aquatic systems from
many sources. Copper at sublethal levels have been recognised as a stressor
