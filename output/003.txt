To determine the effects of chitin (poly [1â€”>4]-[>â€™-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) on
the innate immune response of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.), ï¬�sh were
fed diets containing O mg (control), 25, 50 or 100 mg kg I 1 chitin for 2, 4 and 6
weeks. Lysozyme and natural haemolytic complement activities, together with
head-kidney leucocyte respiratory burst, phagocytic and cytotoxic activities,
were studied at each of the assayed times. Lysozyme activity was unaffected by
the administration of chitin. The innate humoral and cellular immune
response activities assayed were enhanced by the dietary intake of chitin,
each increasing at a different time: natural haemolytic complement activity
and cytotoxic activity after 2 weeks of treatment, respiratory burst activity
from 4 weeks and phagocytic activity after 6 weeks, although, unlike the other
activities, no statistically signiï¬�cant differences were observed in the ï¬�rst.
The results indicate that chitin increases the activity of the seabream innate
immune system, and its use as an immunostimulant is discussed, especially
with regards to the protective role. itâ€˜) 2001 Academic Press

I. Introduction
Many substances from different sources (bacterial components, chemica
agents, animal or plant extracts etc) have been studied as prospectiv'
immunostimulants for ï¬�sh (reviewed by Sakai, 1999), and some have bee]
reported to confer a degree of protection against several diseases commonlj
found in farmed ï¬�sh, such as Vibrio anguillarum, Aeromonas salmonicida o
Yersinia ruckeri (Kajita et al., 1990; Raa et al., 1992; Baulny et al., 1996; Mulerr
et al., 1998). Of these substances obtained from natural sources (which, beside
possessing other interesting properties, are non-toxic, biodegradable am
biocompatible), chitin and chitosan (de-N-aceylated chitin) have receive<
little attention with regard to ï¬�sh (Anderson & Siwicki, 1994; Kawakami et al,
1998; Esteban et al., 2000) compared to other substances like vitamins o
glucans (Hardie et al., 1991; Blazer, 1992; Chen & Ainsworth, 1992; Jeney Ã©
Anderson, 1993; Thompson et al., 1993; Robertsen et al., 1994; Ortuï¬�o et al.
